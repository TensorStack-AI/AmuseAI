## GPU Support
Amuse provides multiple GPU backends, allowing you to choose the best option for your hardware and operating system.

### CUDA (Nvidia)
NVIDIA GPUs can use **CUDA 13.0** for native GPU acceleration. RTX-enabled cards are strongly recommended for the best generation performance, as they provide Tensor Cores specifically designed to accelerate AI workloads. Legacy architectures such as Pascal and Maxwell may work, but are not recommended for optimal performance.

> NVIDIA driver version `580.65` or later is required for CUDA 13.0 compatibility.


### ROCm (AMD)
AMD GPUs can use **ROCm 7.14.0** for native GPU acceleration. ROCm provides support for compatible Radeon and Instinct hardware, offering an alternative to CUDA for AMD-based systems. Performance and supported features may vary depending on the specific GPU architecture and operating system.

> AMD driver version `26.8.1` or later is required for ROCm 7.14.0 compatibility.


### Vulkan (AMD, Nvidia, Intel)
**Vulkan** provides a cross-vendor GPU backend that can be used on compatible hardware without requiring CUDA or ROCm. This makes it particularly useful for GPUs and systems that do not have access to a supported CUDA or ROCm environment.

>  Vulkan support depends on the capabilities of the installed GPU and Vulkan driver.

---

> **Windows 11:** Users may need to `Run As Administrator` during environment creation if environment setup fails.

> **Note:** Actual GPU compatibility and performance depend on the GPU model, driver version, operating system, and backend being used.
